## Assignment 1

## GCC Compilation: C Program
### Step 1
* In the Linux Environment, create a new C Program file using any editor.
* Command used to create C program: gedit filename.c 
  1. **Code :**
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        int i, n=200, sum=0;
        for(i=1; i<=n; ){
          sum = sum + i;
          i=i+1;
        }
        printf("The sum from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
* Save the program and compile your code in the terminal window using GCC compiler.

### Step 2
Run the executable program and see the output in the terminal window.
### Output
The picture below represents the compiling  C code using gcc and  running  its output using a.out

## RISC-V Compilation:C Program
### Step 1
1. **Code Snippet:**
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        int i, n=200, sum=0;
        for(i=1; i<=n; ){
          sum = sum + i;
          i=i+1;
        }
        printf("The sum from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
* Compile the C code on RISC-V compiler

* Now create the object file (.o) ,which is the output of the compiler as shown in the procedure shown below.

### Step 2
* Run the executable program and see the output in the terminal window.
![Screenshot from 2024-08-08 01-02-03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88d0d7dc-2457-4412-afc5-436743236450)

* For the "main" section, we can calculate the number of instructions  by counting each individual instruction.

* E.g.: No. of instruction in main block = 15 instructions

### Step 3
* Compile the code again with the compiler flag set as **-Ofast** and observe the generated assembly code
![Screenshot from 2024-08-08 01-02-38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb7cc10-20e5-4848-b912-1d94889d1b2d)


* Assembly code generated with **-Ofast** compiler flag
![Screenshot from 2024-08-08 01-03-04](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/682644af-f0db-4c8d-b393-2bc8fee9ec28)


*We can see that the number of instructions has decreased from 15 to 12 compared to the previous case.
The -O1 optimization flag provides moderate code optimization, adhering closely to standards, while the -Ofast flag offers more aggressive optimization, aiming for the highest possible performance but potentially deviating from some standards to achieve better results.

  
## Assignment 2
## RISC-V COMPILER OUTPUT and DEBUGGING

Find the output of the C program on the RISC V Compiler using the Spike command and debug the code

## Check the Output and compare with previous output.
We are going to have find the result of n numbers on the RISCV compiler using the SPIKE command instead of gcc and risc-v compiler.

### Code for compiling the objdump file
```bash
spike pk 1tonsum.o
```
### The compiled code using SPIKE command along with object dump file
![Similar result for GCC and RISCV compiler when run the program] ![Screenshot from 2024-08-08 01-50-32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54c475c9-cd8c-4e37-896f-f8e2b89fcf8c)

* Here we can see that we get the same output in both the process.


## Debug using SPIKE debugger

### Code for debugging the assembly code 
```bash
spike -d pk 1tonsum.o
```
We will allow the Spike debugger to run until the main function, specifically until the 100b0 instruction. After that, we will manually continue debugging and inspect the a0 register before and after the execution. We observe that the instruction lui a0, 0x21 updates the a0 register from 0x0000000000000000 to 0x000000000005000
```bash
until pc 0 100b0
```
Next, we will manually debug the next instruction i.e., addi sp, sp, -16. This instruction decrements the stack pointer (sp) by 16. Before executing this instruction, the sp register held the value 0x0000003ffffffb50, which is then updated to 0x0000003ffffffb40.
```bash
reg 0 sp
```
In the assembly code we can see that the value of the stack pointer is being reduced by 10 in hexadecimal we is equivalent to being reduced by 16 in decimal notation.

## The same thing repeats  for -O1(as done for -Ofast earlier) 

```bash
until pc 0 10184
```
